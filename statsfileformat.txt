The stats file format is based on JSON, with a checksum to prevent casual editing. Each stat and achievement is stored in the "stats-change" part, being split into two parts, the ID and value, like this:

{"ID":value},

The achievements are stored as number of times completed for the value with the following ID's:

The statistics are stored with the following ID's:

Code: Select all
        * 1000: Game Started
        * 1001: Worlds Created
        * 1002: Worlds Loaded
        * 1003: Multiplayer Games Joined
        * 1004: Game Left
        * 1100: Game Ticks Played //(20 ticks per second)
        * 2000: Distance Walked //All measurements are in cm (Each block is 1m x 1m)
        * 2001: Distance Swam
        * 2002: Distance Fallen
        * 2003: Distance Climbed
        * 2004: Distance Flown
        * 2005: Distance Dived
        * 2006: Distance by Minecart
        * 2007: Distance by Boat
        * 2008: Distance by Pig
        * 2010: Times Jumped

        * 2023: Mob Kills
        * 2024: Player Kills
        * 2025: Fish Caught



The stats for individual items and blocks used the block/item ID added to a base value:

Code: Select all
        * 16777216 + (Item/Block ID): Blocks Mined
        * 16842752 + (Item/Block ID): Items Crafted
        * 16908288 + (Item/Block ID): Items Used
        * 16973824 + (Item/Block ID): Items Broken




The checksum is an MD5 hash of a string which always starts with the session ID, which is always local at the moment.
Then for each stat/achievement a hash is read from a file (map.txt in the minecraft.jar), each stat/achievement ID is followed by a comma then the hash within that file. For each stat/achievement you append the string you are MD5'ing with the hash for the ID of the stat, followed by a comma, then the stat ID, then another comma.

For example, if the only stat is times jumped [ID 2010] as 10, the checksum would be the MD5 of:

Code: Select all
    locald0818779df1b967cc2f8ffc3ada631ec,10,



I hope this helps, if there is anything else you need to know about the format then let me know.
